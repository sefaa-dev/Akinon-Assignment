## My Approaches
1- In PowerShell, first chocolatey and then node js will be installed.<br/>
2- On the Android side, a value will be taken from the user, for example 7<br/>
3- This given value will be posted to the server I created myself, to the local host.<br/>
4- Since I don't know asp, .net, PHP, node js is the most simpler server side language for me at this time.<br/>
5- After taking the value (Remember that it is 7 as an example) entered by the user and posting it, the fibonacci value will be calculated on the node js side.<br/>
6- Calculated fibonacci series will be exported as JSON<br/>
7- Since the value 7 is already posted on the android side, the server will have to respond<br/>
8- I also created the server, the server's response will be given as JSON and will be received by android.<br/>
9- Finally, the answer will be shown to the user, like this is your fibonacci value. <br/>
10- For Fibonacci it could be --> localhost:3000/api/fibonacci<br/>

Scenario 2,
Send the function result to my web service URL with libraries such as retrofit or volley, and then send the request to the database.
I need to save and write a function that shows which results were sent before in that web service.


I just started learning Docker, so I couldn't prepare this part until assignment last acception date.
But I make you sure that If I am accepted to the academy, I will make great efforts to learn technologies such as docker, python, jenkins quickly. I promise for sure. 
I am already very excited to have the chance to learn these technologies by having the chance to ask questions to engineers who have experience
in these technologies.
Thanks for your tolerances.
